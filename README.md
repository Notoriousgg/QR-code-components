## Overview
In this project I mainly needed to focus on QR code component design.

## The challenge
This is a Bitcamp fall 2022 challenge number 1. Challenge is to make a page look as close to the design as possible.

## My Process
* Changed the background colour
* Created a card element
* Added image into a card
* Added the heading and a paragraph into a card
* Styled a card element
* Styled text elements

### Built with
* HTML5
* CSS
* Flexbox

### What I learned
Working on this project I learned how to use flexbox, how to customize the elements interface using css, etc. In short, everything that you see in the code, I learned in the process of making the project and from different sources.

### Continued development
This is my first project, I continue to learn and develop. At this point I am interested in front end but I don't know exactly because I am new in this field and I may think differently when I get to know the world of development.
